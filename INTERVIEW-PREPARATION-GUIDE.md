**Evidence**: Share GitHub repo, show architecture diagram

### **Scenario 2: System Design Interview**
**Interviewer**: "Design a scalable e-commerce platform"

**Your Response** (using both):
*"I actually implemented exactly this scenario. Here's my GitHub repo with the complete solution, and I wrote a detailed blog post about the challenges and solutions..."*

**Evidence**: GitHub for technical details, Medium for problem-solving approach

### **Scenario 3: Behavioral Interview**
**Interviewer**: "Tell me about a time you overcame a technical challenge"

**Your Response** (using Medium story):
*"I was deploying a microservices platform and ran into resource constraints that caused system failures. Here's how I diagnosed and solved it..."*

**Evidence**: Medium blog tells the story, GitHub shows the solution
